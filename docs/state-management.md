# State Management

This document explains the state management approach used in the Crypto Price Tracker application.

## Why We Chose Zustand

For this project, we selected [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) as our state management solution. Here's why:

### Advantages of Zustand

1. **Simplicity**: Zustand has a minimal API that's easy to learn and use.
2. **Performance**: It's built on top of React's useState hook and uses the React Concurrent Mode-friendly approach.
3. **Lightweight**: Zustand is very small (less than 1KB), which helps keep our bundle size minimal.
4. **Flexible**: It works well with both simple and complex state scenarios.
5. **DevTools Integration**: It has good integration with Redux DevTools for debugging.

### Comparison with Alternatives

- **Redux**: More boilerplate and complexity than needed for this application
- **Context API**: Good for prop drilling but doesn't include built-in state management
- **MobX**: More complex and opinionated than necessary
- **React Query**: Excellent for data fetching but overkill for UI state

## Store Implementation

Our Zustand store is implemented in `store/cryptoStore.ts` and includes:

```typescript
interface CryptoState {
  cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrency[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  search: string;
  fetchCryptocurrencies: () => Promise<void>;
  setSearch: (search: string) => void;
}
