# Challenges & Solutions

This document outlines the key challenges faced during development and the solutions implemented.

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge
The CoinGecko API has strict rate limits on their free tier, which could lead to request failures during development and testing.

### Solution
We implemented several strategies to work around this limitation:
1. **Debouncing Search Requests**: We delay API calls when users type in the search bar
2. **Caching Results**: We cache API responses for a short period (30 seconds)
3. **Limiting Auto-Refresh**: We set the auto-refresh interval to 60 seconds instead of more frequent updates
4. **Visual Feedback**: We added clear loading indicators so users understand when data is being fetched

## Responsive Design

### Challenge
Creating a consistent and appealing UI across different device sizes while maintaining usability.

### Solution
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: We designed the UI for mobile devices first, then enhanced it for larger screens
2. **CSS Grid with Breakpoints**: We used CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints to adjust the layout
3. **Flexible Components**: Components adjust their size and positioning based on screen width
4. **Testing on Multiple Devices**: We tested the UI on various screen sizes to ensure consistency

## State Management Complexity

### Challenge
Managing loading states, errors, search functionality, and auto-refresh in a clean, maintainable way.

### Solution
1. **Zustand Store**: We centralized state management in a Zustand store
2. **Action Creators**: We created clear action creators for each state change
3. **Component Separation**: We separated UI components from state management logic
4. **Error Boundary**: We implemented error boundaries to handle unexpected failures gracefully

## Search Performance

### Challenge
Ensuring search functionality remains responsive and efficient, especially when dealing with potentially hundreds of cryptocurrencies.

### Solution
1. **Debounced Input**: We debounced the search input to reduce API calls
2. **Server-Side Filtering**: We leverage the API's built-in filtering when possible
3. **Client-Side Caching**: We cache search results to avoid redundant API calls
4. **Pagination Support**: We added support for paginated results when searching through large datasets

## Testing Considerations

### Challenge
Ensuring the application works correctly across different scenarios and edge cases.

### Solution
1. **Error State Testing**: We thoroughly tested error handling by simulating API failures
2. **Empty State Handling**: We implemented graceful UI for empty search results
3. **Loading Indicators**: We added clear loading indicators for all asynchronous operations
4. **Network Resilience**: We implemented retry logic for transient network failures
